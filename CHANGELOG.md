<br/>

<p>
<b>Version 1.1.72</b> - Mai 2020<br/>
- Update knx api to 2.3.19<br/>
- FIX: fixed a problem when issuing a gateway ip change to a watchdog node, if you've a tunneling KNX Interface and node-red v. 0.20 or below.<br/>
- FIX: above related with connection status request if tunneling mode, sometime giving "timed out waiting for CONNECTIONSTATE_RESPONSE" errors.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.71</b> - Mai 2020<br/>
- Update knx api to 2.3.18<br/>
- NEW: added Datapoint 251.600 RGBW<br/>
- State request to the BUS is now sent every 60 seconds instead of 10, for lowering the BUS traffic (see changelog for Version 1.1.68)<br/>
- More relaxed handling of errors coming from an query to a KNX/IP interface not always reponding to connection status (in case, for example, of some implementations of knxd)<br/>
- Watchdog: on "basic Ethernet check", switched to ping mode detection. With the introduction of "echo local telegrams" in unicast mode, since some versions ago, the watchdog must yet check for the KNX Interface using Ping, otherwise, the lost of connection is never trapped. Other than that, the "basic Ethernet check" works only with KNX Interfaces, because the router uses multicast and multicast is connectionless.<br/>
</p>

- Update knxultimate-api. Yet the nodes connected to an IP Interface, behaves like the nodes connected to an IP Router. See option <b>Echo sent message to all node with same Group Address</b> in the Gateway configuration wiki.<br/>
- I'm internationalizing the node <b>(Deutsch, Italiano, English)</b> with the help of <b>@svenflender</b>, so please be patient if some parts are still only in english. Internationalization is working with node-red version 1.0.3 and above. Versions below, does have issues in the i18n module, so knx-ultimate falls back to english. Please upgrade node-red.<br/>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.38</b> - March 2020<br/>
- Yet, if you import an ETS CSV file without datapoints, a fake datapoint 1.001 will be used (if you selected to force import the group address)<br/>
- Update help and wiki to reflect the change<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.37</b> - Feb 2020<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.24</b> - Jan 2020<br/>
- FIX: If the message has no payload and no readstatus, throw an error. If you requests a readstatus, there's no need to pass a payload. Previously, the node has gone in stop mode if the payload was null, thus having readstatus.<br/>
- Added Read Request sample in the Wiki.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.22</b><br/>
- Added msg.previouspayload that stores the previous node value<br/>

- Updated node info and wiki to reflect the new UI changes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.20</b><br/>
- Config node UI cleanup.<br/>

- Added Homekit, Alexa and Google Assistant samples in the wiki.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.19</b><br/>
- More UI cleanup.
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.18</b><br/>
- Removed the handling of the telegram queue's delay buffer from underlying KNX.js API, because it doesn't respect the telegram queue order.<br/>
- Added own message queue buffer with delay of 50 millisecs. Now the telegrams order is respected.<br/>
- In the node's configuration, added an advanced tab, that hides or shows the advanced options; now the configuration is much more clean. Advanced Options opens up automatically if the values have been changed from defaults.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.17</b><br/>
- Fixed autorespond to a read request.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.16</b><br/>
- Added a minimum delay of 60milliseconds between telegrams, when the node sends telegrams to the BUS, to avoid flooding the KNX BUS, causing a loss of telegrams. The KNX.org specs allows max 50 telegrams per seconds (max 1 telegram each 20milliseconds), but in real life, this is too much.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.15</b><br/>
- Updated underlying API to 2.3.6 with some bugfixes.<br/>
- Added FAQ and troubleshoot in the Wiki.<br/>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.12</b><br/>
- Fixed a little issue where the status message is not displayed if the node has not well wrote group address (for example 1/5 instead of 1/5/1). Thanks @arsiesis.<br/>
- Cleaned up the layout of config window.<br/>
- Changed option <b>Listen to all Group Addresses</b> to a more comprensible <b>Universal mode (listen to all Group Addresses)</b>.<br/>
- The node can now be used as universal KNX sender/receiver without the need of the ETS CSV File.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.10</b><br/>
- Auto send node value as response to the KNX Bus. It works in conjunction with React to event GroupValue read. When checked, whenever the node receives a read request from bus, it sends a response to the KNX Bus with the stored payload value.<br/>
- Fixed an issue where if you have a node set to Universal mode (listen to all Group Addresses) (with ETS CSV File set) and you create a new node having a Group Addr. not in the ETS CSV file, an exception is raised but not caught and the nodes may not receive the values from KNX BUS.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.9</b><br/>
- Fixed visual glitch when create a new freshly Config Node.<br/>
- Added 3 options in the config-node to select what to display in the node status, for a cleaner flow or for a clearer flow.<br/>
- Fixed issue with IP Interfaces. On each deploy, the node doesn't lock tunnels anymore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.8</b><br/>
- For new nodes, the rbe output filter is enabled by default. You can always turn it off in the options. This helps novice users avoiding loops.<br/>
- Fixed an issue where if the connection is in tunnel mode and the connection to the IP Interface or KNX Bus is lost, the node trows an unhandled exception. Thanks to User Maarten200.<br/>
- Added the word "knxUltimate" before any log, to identify that the log comes from the knx-ultimate node.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.7</b><br/>
- Fixed bind to ethernet. Now you can manually input the ethernet name as well. Thanks to user rotorman.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.6</b><br/>
- Fixed inport CSV from ETS where there is return carriages and parenthesis in the Group Address description. Thanks to user xrk.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.4</b><br/>
- Last changed status date/time shortened out<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.3</b><br/>
- In node status, added the last changed status date/time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.1.2</b><br/>
- When you asks for a read on a node having Listen All Group Addresses set to true, due to a low delay between each KNX telegram, some telegrams are discarded. Increased the delay between telegram to avoid that.<br/>
- Added RBE filter for the INPUT from KNX bus as well.<br/>
- Added the option to bind to local ethernet interface, in case you have more than one, for example, ethernet and wifi.<br/>
- Fixed option suppress_ack_ldatareq not retain after restart.<br/>

</p>
<p>
<b>Version 1.0.16</b><br/>
- Input message format has been CHANGED! please see the wiki!!!.<br/>
